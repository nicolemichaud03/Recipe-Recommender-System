## Title

Elevator Pitch

## Business Problem:
(data, target, rationale), Using data, can we predict target? This would be useful because rationale.

Using user and recipe data from Food.com, can we give the top 3 recommendations for the next recipes that users should try, taking into account their dietary specifications?
This would be useful, because it can be time consuming and repetitive for people to come up with new recipes to make all the time, especially when their options are narrowed down due to dietary restrictions. If a recommender system took into account not only a user's preferences, based on past recipes that the user has rated highly, but also the type of diet category that the user is most likely to enjoy a recipe from, then this can simplify this task for the user and in turn, make them favor our service more for finding recipes in the future.

## Business Understanding and Data Understanding

- Explain the project context, using at least one citation to demonstrate your domain understanding
- Consider including visualizations here as well

## Modeling and Evaluation
-What kind of model(s) did you use?
-How well did your final model perform, compared to the baseline?

## Conclusion
-How would you recommend that your model be used?


### Limitations:

### Next Steps:
- experiment with different depths for the neural network model (https://www.tensorflow.org/recommenders/examples/deep_recommenders)
- look at user reviews (and other text features of the recipes). I didn't do this in this project, because the goal was not sentiment analysis.
- cross network
